    "The grade school way is $n^2$ complex. For each digit of x, we multiply by each digit of y $(n^2)$. Then, to add the partial products, we perform approximately $n^2$ additions of 2 numbers. $2n^2 \\approx n^2$.\n",

Since we already know ac and bd, it's straightforward. Thus, our Katsubara algorithm:\n",

    "### Programming Assignment 1: Implementing Karatsuba division\n",
    "02/05/17\n",
    "\n",
    "My assignment was to implement karatsuba division in a programming language of my choice, then run it on two obscenely large numbers (64 digits each, to be exact). I did it incorrectly for a couple hours before throwing in the towel (sorry sorry) and editing some other person's code until I got the right answer (very very sorry sorry). I submitted at least like, 5 or 6 times before I got the right answer. Really quite frustrating. Anyways. I want to document some of the mistakes I made over the course of trying to solve this problem, and contrast my original solution with the final one I arrived at. From least complex to most complex:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I spelled *karatsuba* as *katsubara* (darn metathesis. Although I think I switched around three syllables, ha!). Not technically relevant, but whoops.\n",
    "- Some of the mathematical operations I performed (namely, / division, which yields a float) gave me floats instead of integers. It turns out that floating point arithmetic in Python is by necessity imprecise (see https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html), and integer operations are extremely precise. I needed to switch out my / for //. (At the *very* beginning, I used divmod for a,b and c,d pairs because I thought I was being clever. But alas, divmod uses the / operator as well.) Also! It was due to this oversight that I kept getting an error \"maximum recursion depth exceeded while getting the str of an object.\" I was trying to cast floats as strings; not wise.\n",
    "- I didn't account for cases in which x and y might have a different number of digits, or have an odd number of digits (the latter case would lead to the former). I assumed that, because 64 is a power of 2, both integers would break down perfectly into even halves all the way down to the base case. My assumption is incorrect. Take a simple 4-digit example: 6702. Breaking this down, we get 67 and...2? They're uneven. I initially took n to be the number of digits in x; this is completely arbitrary but harmless. The issue comes with n and n/2. Recall that this is the Karatsuba formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x \\cdot y = 10^{n}ac + 10^{n/2}[(a+b)(c+d) - ac - bd] + bd$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- If x and y don't contain an even number of digits, however, then the first expression ac shouldn't necessarily be raised to n. Let's say that x is 3 digits long. Then $n=3$ and $n/2=1$. Thus, we really shouldn't raise ac to $10^n$ ($10^3$), but $10^{n/2*2}$ instead, which is $10^2$."

I converted my function to take in and output strings. I changed the input/output type to integer, and it didn't make a difference.\n",

It actually doesn't matter which one we set as the base case -- although we should use the AND case if we want to stay true to the spirit of Karatsuba multiplication. For instance, if x is 5 (one digit) and y is 21 (two digits), we get the same answer regardless of whether we take their product directly (x * y) or we break x into $a=0, b=5$ and y into $c=2, d=1$ and apply one more layer of Karatsuba: 105."

    "The first half of this week focuses on the Divide and Conquer approach to algorithms, which consists of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems (conceptually or literally).\n",
    "2. Conquer via recursive calls. Do some clean-up.\n",
    "3. Combine solutions of the subproblems into one for the original problem.\n",

    "With that, I'm going to implement an algorithm for counting inversions in an array. An inversion is defined as a pair of items at indices x, y for which array[x] > array[y] (i.e., the two items are out of order). We count inversions by counting the number of pairs in an array that are out of order. For a given array, the number of inversions is going to be between 0 (sorted array) or ${n\\choose 2}$ (all possible pairs of items -- this is the number of inversions for an array that is completely reversed).\n",

    "This algorithm 'piggybacks' off of merge sort; the merge step is also used to count inversions. The key insight is this: when we take an item from the right sub-array and place it in our newly sorted array, the number of inversions that item is a part of is equal to the number of items in the left sub-array that remain."

    "- there's a way to partition the array (and do the whole sort, in fact) without taking up any additional memory. The entirety of quicksort can be performed in place, which makes it more memory efficient than mergesort (slightly sad because mergesort is a favorite of mine).\n",

Let's implement quicksort now! We'll default to selecting the first item in the sub-array as our pivot (lol) and write code that partitions in place. Pretty cool."

    "The homework for this week involves counting the number of comparisons quickSort makes when using a particular pivot selection method. There are three that the assignment asks us to implement: choosing the first element as the pivot (naive), choosing the last element (equally naive), and choosing the median of the first, last, and middle element of the subarray (decidedly less naive). As we can see below, the third makes drastically fewer comparisons than the first two: \n",

    "It took me a while to get these numbers, though. Along the way, I made a couple (in hindsight) really quite silly mistakes. Here they are, a reminder that I should never do something this silly again:\n",
    "- I got the first one wrong because while I counted the number of comparisons each *sub*array made, I totally neglected to count the very first level of comparisons at the root -- n-1 (in our case, 10,000-1) comparisons. Clever.\n",
    "- Finding the middle index of a subarray for the last pivot selection method (median of first, middle, last). Who knew that (left - right) // 2 wasn't the right way to go about it? This code would be fine if I were trying to find half of the *difference* between the first and the last elements. But I wasn't. I was looking for the middle element, which (duh) we find by calculating (left *+* right) // 2. The luxury of Python list concatenation is making me lazy, because I kept expecting that every single subarray just started at index 0. Nope, they don't. Thank goodness I'm done."

    "We start the last week of this course (that was fast!) by discussing yet another randomized algorithm: a selection algorithm that computes the $i^{th}$ smallest element in an unsorted array in linear time. Cool, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, say we want to find the median of an array (where the median is the $\\frac{n}2$nd smallest element in an even array, $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ in an odd array). We could do this by *reducing* the problem to one of sorting. We sort the algorithm using merge sort or quicksort, then simply access the $i^{th}$ element. This takes $O(nlogn)$ time. It turns out that selection is easier than sorting; we can do even better. We can find the $i^{th}$ order statistic in linear time using a special ingredient; randomness. (Interesting tidbit: it's a established fact that the fastest sorting can ever get is $O(nlogn)$. There is no such thing as a linear sorting algorithm. Quite curious about how to prove this, actually.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to pivot and partition in the same way as quicksort. However, instead of getting us closer to a sorted array, the act of partioning lets us narrow down the search space for where our target element is. Let's say we want to find the 5th order statistic (5th smallest item) in an array, and we pick a pivot that happens to be the 3rd smallest. Now we know that the thing we're looking for is going to be in the second sub-array. We do one recursive call on that subarray (vs. two in quick sort) and keep searching until we find it!\n",

    "### Minimum Graph Cuts: the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A cut of a graph (V, E) is a partition of the graph into two non-empty sets A and B. The minimum cut of a graph is the grouping of a graph into two parts A and B such that A and B have the fewest number of crossing edges as possible. This can be useful for identifying bottlenecks in networks, as a first-order heuristic for detecting communities in social networks, and for edge detection in image segmentation. Cool, right? So how does one find the minimum cut of a graph?\n",
