Binary search is much the same way (assuming a sorted array list): we state our 'guess' as the midpoint of the array. If it's the item we're looking for, great! Otherwise, we search the latter half of the array if the value is higher than the midpoint, and the first half if it's lower."

We can think of placing arrays in memory like seating friends together at a movie; we need to find a continuous sequence of seats for the friends, and if we want room for additional friends, we must either save extra seats from the beginning (wasteful in memory, rude irl) or move to a new place each time more friends come. \n",
